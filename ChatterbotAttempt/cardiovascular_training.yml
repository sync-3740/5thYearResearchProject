- - What is blood pressure
  - When the heart pumps blood around the body, the blood puts pressure on the walls of blood vessels. This is known as blood pressure.
- - What is blood pressure measured in
  - Blood pressure is measured in millimetres of mercury, which is noted as mmHg
- - What do the blood pressure numbers mean
  - All blood pressure measurements include two numbers which are systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). These numbers reflect the pressure against blood vessel walls when the heart contracts (SBP) and relaxes (DBP) every time it beats
- - can you give an example of a normal blood pressure measure
  - A typical blood pressure measurement may look like this \n 120/80 mmHg, which is read as “120 over 80 millimetres of mercury”. The first number (120) is the SBP, and the second number (80) is the DBP
